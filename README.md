***ASAP Utah Redesign***

This project is a redesign of the asaputah.wordpress.com website. It is a local avian sanctuary that I have personally taken animals to and the website needed some sprucing up.
This is my attempt at making a more streamlined, uniform website.

**Tech Stack**
The front end is made using React JS, Tailwind, and React Router.
The back end utilizes Node.js, Express, SQL, Sequelize, and Axios.

**Data Structure**
There is one table in the project currently, and it is used to store data about relocations, intakes, and adoptions. The data is populated in the Stats subtab of the About page.

**Scripts**
There are a few scripts that were made for the project, they include:
*"dev"* : Runs the project so you are able to view in a browser.
*"initdb"* : Initializes the database for the project.
*"seed"* : Runs the seed.js file in the server folder, seeds said database.
